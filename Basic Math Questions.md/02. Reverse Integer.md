# Reverse Integer
__Problem Statement:Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.__

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123

Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: x = -123

Output: -321
